### Overview

This tutorial will get you up to speed with all the skills necessary to work
with [`lnd`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd). We will be building a
Bitcoin micropayments paywall into a news site!

Those seeking more conceptual familiarity with the Lightning Network can read
through the [LND Overview and Developer Guide](/overview/). It also contains a
more in-depth explanation of the components covered in this tutorial, and
includes best practices for integrating LND. It is not required knowledge for
completing this tutorial, but we recommend that you at least skim through the
guide before attempting to build your own app.

The tutorial assumes you have completed installation of Go, `btcd`, and `lnd`
on simnet. If not, the [installation instructions](/guides/installation/) will
guide you through the process.
